# NITCommute

This project consists of an Android, iOS & Web Application to keep a track of the shuttles and vehicles running in NIT Calicut campus.
It will display the current location of the shuttles and their expected time to reach a particular stop.
Notification can also be provided to the user depending upon his location and the shuttles nearby.
